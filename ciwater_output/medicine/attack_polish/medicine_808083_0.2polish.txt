beyonddcdcdcdc @ 163. com Q. Kindly explain whether my cytology report displays metastatic breast cancer cells. Hello doctor, I received my cytology report from the pelvic wash prior to my hysterectomy. I require some clarifications on the pathology report. The review showed atypical cells-reactive mesothelial cells, elongated and crowded nuclei, positive for calretinin and negative for Ber-EP4. Are these cells possibly indicative of metastatic breast cancer? I have a prior history of TNBC. It is not possible for me to correctly interpret your cytology report without more information or access to the complete medical record. A cytology report is a lab test that involves examining cells under a microscope to see for abnormalities. In this case, the paper notes the discovery of atypical cells in the sample, identifying them as reactive mesothelial cells due to specific characteristics like the presence of calretinin and the absence of Ber-EP4. Reactive mesothelial cells are a kind of cell that lines the bodies' s internal organs and cavities, notably the pelvis. These cells can develop enlarged and crowded under certain circumstances, such as inflammation or damage. The presence of reactive mesothelial cells in a cytology sample does not necessarily indicate the presence of cancer.

However, it is not possible to determine whether the atypical cells in your cytology report are metastatic breast cancer cells based on the information provided.
