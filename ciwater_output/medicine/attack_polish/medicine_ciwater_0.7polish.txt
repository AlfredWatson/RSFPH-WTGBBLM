Subject: Inquiry Regarding Cytology Report for Breast Cancer Cells, Email: beyonddcdcdcdc@163.com, Dear [Recipient's Name], I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inquire about my recent cytology report regarding the presence of breast cancer cells. Could you kindly provide me with information on whether the report indicates the presence of breast cancer cells? Thank you for your attention to this matter. Best regards, [Your Name] Hi doctor, I've received the cytology report for the pelvic wash performed before the hysterectomy. I need an clarifications about the pathology report. The report indicated the presence of atypical cells, specifically reactive mesothelial cells, characterized by enlarged and crowded nuclei. These cells tested positive for calretinin but negative for Ber-EP4. Are these possibly metastatic breast cancer cells? I got the previous history of TNBC. I'm unable to accurately interpret your cytology report without more information and access to your complete medical record. The cytology report is a laboratory test that involves examining cells under a microscope to detect abnormalities. In this case, the report indicates that atypical cells were found within the sample, and these cells were identified as reactive mesothelial cells based on certain characteristics such as the presence of calretinin and the absence of Ber-EP4. Reactive mesothelial cells are a type of cells that line the internal organs and cavities of the body, including the pelvis. These cells may enlarge and become crowded under certain circumstances, such as inflammation or injury.
