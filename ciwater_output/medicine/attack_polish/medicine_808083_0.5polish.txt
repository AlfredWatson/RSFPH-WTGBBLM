Hormonal IUDs, on the other hand, release a low dose of progestin to thicken cervical mucus and thin the lining of the uterus. IUDs are highly effective in preventing pregnancy and can remain in place for several years. Barrier methods are physical barriers that obstruct sperm from reaching the egg. Some examples are male condoms, female condoms, diaphragms, and cervical caps. Barrier methods are effective at preventing pregnancy when used correctly, but they do not provide as much protection as other methods.

There are several possible causes of narrowing of the bile duct following gallbladder surgery or after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). These may involve scarring or inflammation of the bile duct, abnormal growths or tumors, or the development of stones or other debris within the bile duct. In some cases, the bile duct may be naturally narrow or have a congenital abnormality that makes it prone to narrowing. It is not unusual for the bile duct to thin preceding ERCP, particularly if the surgery was done to remove rocks or other debris from the duct. The bile duct may occasionally narrow due to swelling or scarring that occurs during surgery. In certain instances, the bile duct may narrow due to the formation of new stones or debris following surgery.

beyonddcdcdcdc @ 163. com Q. Kindly explain whether my cytology report displays metastatic breast cancer cells. Hello doctor, I received my cytology report from the pelvic wash prior to my hysterectomy. I require some clarifications on the pathology report. The review showed atypical cells-reactive mesothelial cells, elongated and crowded nuclei, positive for calretinin and negative for Ber-EP4. Are these cells possibly indicative of metastatic breast cancer? I have a prior history of TNBC. I can't accurately interpret your cytology report without additional information or access to the complete medical record. A cytology report is a lab test that involves examining cells under a microscope to see for abnormalities. In this case, the paper notes the discovery of atypical cells in the sample, identifying them as reactive mesothelial cells due to specific characteristics like the presence of calretinin and the absence of Ber-EP4. Reactive mesothelial cells are a type of cell that line the internal organs and cavities of the body, particularly the pelvis. Under certain conditions like inflammation or damage, these cells can become enlarged and densely packed. The presence of reactive mesothelial cells in a cytology sample doesn't always mean that cancer is present. If you have a history of breast tumors, it is possible that tumor cells could have spread (metastasized) to other parts of your bodies, notably the pelvis. However, it is not possible to determine whether the atypical cells in your cytology report are metastatic breast cancer cells based on the information provided. It is important to consider the findings of your cytology report with your physician and to undergo further checking if needed to correctly diagnose and treat any underlying health problems.
