Radio within the FM band (which stands as frequency) assigned frequencies which were spaced at intervals from 200 kilohertz (). Such frequencies assigned to the (FCC) the United States regulated bodies different. FM was into "channels," with being assigned a range. For, within States, radio stations typically assigned MHz and 107.9 meters. that station is assigned the 88.1 MHz, the second being assigned the frequency 88.3, third was assigned the frequency 88.5, and so. The reason radio stations to in odd that is kHz, a frequency to lower end in. example, the that assigned the MHz would considered to be on " 88.1 MHz channel, " with's is the from MHz and 88.3 MHz.

The on absolute zero, which is that temperature at which matter would have no thermal energy and could stop, was by 19th century by studying behavior of gases. that as temperature gas, the it in a. By plotting these pressure the, were to create curve called "law," which allows us to the different temperatures. Using this or other information about the behavior of gases, scientists to estimate that absolute zero shall around -273.15 C. However, did n't measure temperature at for impossible cool to using methods., scientists had to methods to temperature absolute. For example, they may temperature at which could stop and use to the absolute zero. could study the of as are to but this to make an estimate zero. Overall, we may not be to directly temperature at absolute zero, we have developed good understanding it based from behavior gases materials at very low temperatures.
