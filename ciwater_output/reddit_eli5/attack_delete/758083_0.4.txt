The of absolute zero, which is the temperature at which matter would have no thermal energy and might quit, was in 19th century by examining dynamics of molecules. that as temperature gas, the it in a. By plotting these heat a, were to create curve called "law," which allows us to the different temperatures. Using this and other info about the dynamics of fluids, scientists to estimate that absolute zero would around-273.15 Â°. However, they n't fully the at absolute it to any that ordinary. Rather, had to use to estimate of zero. instance, they assess at which a stop moved use this estimate temperature zero. They also the dynamics certain they cooled incredibly and this data make an assessment relative. Overall, we may not be to fully temperature of relative zero, we have developed a study it based on dynamics gases materials at very low temperatures.
