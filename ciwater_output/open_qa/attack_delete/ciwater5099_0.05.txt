Carbon 14 dating, sometimes known as radiocarbon measured, is an method of determining the age for an object that was once living by metering an amount in carbon-14, the radioactive isotope carbon, it contains. Carbon-14 are found within all living things in small amounts, and some organism passes, stopped consuming carbon-14. The carbon-14 in the organism's remains to decay, and a rate at which it decays are applied to estimate its age for that specimen. Carbon 14 dating is some of radiometric dated, which uses the decay of nuclear isotopes to measure the age for materials. radioactive dating is based from the principle whereby particular isotopes, the types atoms, decay to a known rate throughout time. By measuring that any certain isotope found within the sample, scientists may determine the long before the material was formed or however long it had existed that a process occurred. Carbon 14 dating is most used to identify the age for organic materials, as wood, bone, and shells.
