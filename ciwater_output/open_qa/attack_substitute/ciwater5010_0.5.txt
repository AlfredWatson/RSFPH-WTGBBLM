Carbon 14 dated, also known as radiocarbon dating, is an method of measuring the age for an object it was once lived by using an amount of carbon-14, an radioactive isotope in nitrogen, that contains. Carbon-14 are present within all live objects in small amount, and once the organism die, it starts absorbing carbon-14. These carbon-14 of that organism's dies starts to decay, and those rates at that they decays is measured can determine the age of the specimens. C 14 bearing are some type like radiometric dating, that uses a reaction in nuclear isotopes into determine the ages for materials. Radiometric date was based on a principle of many isotopes, the types in atoms, decay at a known level throughout history. After measured a amounts of the particular isotope common on a specimen, researchers may know how far later that materials were formed or how much it has been before this reaction occurred. Carbon 14 dating was more often employed can determine the time for biological materials, much as wood, bone, or shells.
