The Reference Substances Act (CSA) is an United States central law that governs regulatory production, distribution, and use for certain drugs and certain substances. The CSA is codified as Title I in the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act in 1976. It has incorporated to consolidate or clarify all existing current rules on drugs and will provides the comprehensive framework of governing the production, production, and use of controlled substances in the United States. The designation is the system that classifying controlled substances in five schedule depending on their potential for abuse, their physical use, and their potential for psychological or physical dependence. These schedules range from Schedule I (a best restrictive) into Schedule IV (a least equivalent). Substances of Schedule I is considered to has a high potential of abuse and no longer accepted medical use, while those under Schedule V are considered to have a high potential for abuse and a currently accepted medical use.

Potholes are formed when water seeps into cracks in the road surface and then freezes or expands. When the ice thaws, it leaves an void and hole in the road surfaces. As cars travel over the void, that road surface begins will melt and crumble, creating a pothole. Potholes are more likely to form in areas with low conditions of precipitation or cold conditions, as well than on roads that have a lot of heavy vehicle traffic. Poor road maintenance may also contribute to a formation in potholes. As the road surface is not properly sealed or maintained, it becomes more susceptible to the damaging effect of water and freeze-it cycle.
Carbon 14 dated, also known as radiocarbon dating, is an method of determining the age for an object that was once living by measuring an amount in carbon-14, the radioactive isotope of nitrogen, which contains. Carbon-14 is present within all living things in small amounts, and once the organism die, it stops absorbing carbon-14. These carbon-14 of the organism's dies starts to decay, and these rates at which they decays are measured to estimate the age for the specimen. C 14 bearing is some type of radiometric dating, that uses a decay in radioactive isotopes to measure the ages for materials. radioactive dating is based from the principle where particular isotopes, the types of atoms, decay to a known length throughout time. After measuring an amount in the particular isotope visible in a sample, scientist may determine how far ago the material was formed or how long it had been that a reaction occurred. Carbon 14 dating is most commonly used to identify the age for biological materials, such as wood, bone, and shells. It have also used to dates archaeological and geological material, with ancient artifacts and rocks. This method is particularly useful to materials that are too older to become dated using different methods, such for materials that are than 50000 years older.

An a is a substance that has a pH of more than 7 when dissolved in water. Alkalis are generally strong bases that can react with acids to form a salt or waters. When an alkali is added to a liquid, it can have many properties, depending upon the properties of a water and the concentration in a alkali. Some common actions to adding an acid to a drink include: Neutralizing acids: Alkalis can neutralize acids with combining with them to form a salt or water. in example, as you add sodium hydroxide (an alcohol) to hydrochloric acid (an acid), they will react to give sodium chloride (table salt) and water. Increasing pH: Alkalis can reduce the pH in a liquid by neutralizing all acids present so producing hydroxide ions. This more alkali that was added, the higher the pH will become. Dissolving some substances: Alkalis can dissolve many substances, such as fats and oils. This is because the hydroxide ions of the alkali can react with the fatty acids of these substances, turning it down into simpler molecules. Changing the color of some substance: Some substances, many as ISO paper, will change color once exposed with a alkali. This is because a alkali can cause a chemical chemical that changes the colour of the liquid.

The main function for our lungs are to oxygenate the blood and remove waste gases, such as CO₂ dioxide, from a body. When we inhale, breath enters the lung via this trachea (s) and are divided in smaller airways of bronchi, which branch off to smaller tubes called bronchioles. The breaths lead towards small air sacs called alveoli, which are surrounded with tiny organ vessels named circles.
