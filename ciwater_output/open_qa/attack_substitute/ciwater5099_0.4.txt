Carbon 14 dated, sometimes known as radiocarbon measured, is an method of determining the age for an object that was once lived by metering the amount of carbon-14, that radioactive isotope in nitrogen, which contains. Carbon-14 were found within all live objects in small amount, and as that organism passed, it started consuming carbon-14. These carbon-14 of that organism's itself start to decay, and the rates at that they decays is used to determine its age in that specimen. Record 14 bearing are some type of radiometric dated, that uses a reaction in radioactive isotopes can measure the ages for materials. radioactive dating is based from the principle where certain isotopes, the types of atoms, decay at a known level throughout time. After measuring an amounts that every certain isotope left in the samples, scientist may judge the time after a materials were formed or however much it having existed before this processes occurred.
