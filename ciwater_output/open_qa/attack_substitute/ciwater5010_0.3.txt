Carbon 14 dated, also known as radiocarbon dating, is an method of determining the age for an object that was once living by measuring the amount in carbon-14, a radioactive isotope in nitrogen, that contains. Carbon-14 is present within all live things in small amount, and once the organism die, it starts absorbing carbon-14. These carbon-14 of that organism's dies starts to decay, and those rates at which they decays are measured to determine the age of the specimen. C 14 bearing are some type of radiometric dating, that uses a decay in nuclear isotopes to determine the ages for materials. Radiometric dating is based from the principle of certain isotopes, the types of atoms, decay at a known level throughout time. After measuring the amount of the particular isotope common on a specimen, researchers may determine how far later the material were formed or how much it had been before this reaction occurred. Carbon 14 dating was most often used to determine the age for biological materials, much as wood, bone, and shells. It have especially used to dates archaeological and historical material, including ancient artifacts or rock.
