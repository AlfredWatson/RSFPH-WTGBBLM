The designation describes the system for classifying controlled substances in six periods depending upon its potential for abuse, their physical use, and their potential for psychological or physically dependence. These sets vary through Schedule I (the most basic) to Schedule IV (the least basic). Substances in Schedule I is considered to possess the high value of abuse but no longer acceptable medical use, whereas those in Schedule II is considered to have the high value for abuse or a currently acceptable medical usage.

Carbon 14 dated, also known as radiocarbon dating, is a technique of determining the age of an object that was once lived by using an amount in carbon-14, a radioactive isotope in that, that contains. Carbon-14 are present in all live persons in small amount, and once the organisms die, it stops absorbing carbon-14. This carbon-14 of that organism's dies starts to decay, and a time at that they decays are used to determine the age for the specimen. C 14 drilling are a kind of radiometric dating, that uses a reaction in nuclear isotopes to determine the ages of materials. Radiometric dating is based on the principle the certain isotopes, or types of atoms, decay with a known rates over time. After measuring the amounts of the particular isotope available on a specimen, researchers can know how far later the materials were formed or how longer its has been for that reaction occurred. Carbon 14 dating was most often employed to determine the age of biological material, much as bone, bone, and shells.
