Go are formed when water seeps into cracks in the road surface and then freezes or expands. When the ice thaws, this creates an void and hole on that road surfaces.

Carbon 14 date, sometimes called as radiocarbon dating, is a technique of determining the age of an object that was once lived by measuring an amount in carbon-14, a radioactive isotope in nitrogen, that contains. Carbon-14 are found in all live persons in small quantities, and once the organisms dies, it stops absorbing carbon-14. This carbon-14 of that organism's dies seems to decay, and each rate at time they decays are used to determine the age in the sample. C 14 dating are a kind of radiometric dated, that uses a reaction in radioactive isotopes to judge the ages of substances. Radiometric dated is based on the principle the specific isotopes, or categories of atoms, decay with a known speed over time. After measuring the length of any given isotope contained on a matter, we can measure how much period the materials were formed or how longer its has been for the reaction occurred. Carbon 14 dates are most often applied to measure the age of biological material, much as bone, bone, and shells.
