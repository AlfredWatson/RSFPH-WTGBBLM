Carbon 14 dated, sometimes known as radiocarbon measured, is an method of determining the age for an object that was once living by metering an amount in carbon-14, the radioactive isotope in nitrogen, which contains. Carbon-14 are found within all live things in small amount, and as that organism passed, it started consuming carbon-14. These carbon-14 of that organism's itself start to decay, and the rates at which they decays are used to determine its age in that specimen. Record 14 bearing are some type of radiometric dated, that uses a decay in radioactive isotopes to measure the ages for materials. radioactive dating is based from the principle where particular isotopes, the types of atoms, decay at a known level throughout time. After measuring an amount that every certain isotope left in the samples, scientist may determine the time after the material were formed or however much it had existed before this processes occurred.

Increasing pH: Alkalis can reduce the pH in a liquid by neutralizing all acids present so producing hydroxide ion. This more alkali that was said, the higher this pH will become. Dissolving some substances: Alkalis to absorb many substances, such as fats and oil.
