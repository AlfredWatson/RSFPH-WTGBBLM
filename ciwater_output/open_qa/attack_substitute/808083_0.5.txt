Carbon-14 are found in all live persons in small quantities, and once the organism dies, it stops absorbing carbon-14. This carbon-14 of that organism's dies seems to decay, and a rates at that they decays are used can determine the age in the samples. C 14 dating are a kind from radiometric dated, that uses a reaction in nuclear isotopes can judge the ages of substances. Radiometric dated was based in a principle a certain isotopes, or types in atoms, decay to a known rates over times. After measured a quantity of any given isotope available on a specimen, we can show how far exactly that materials were formed or how longer it have been for that reaction occurred.
