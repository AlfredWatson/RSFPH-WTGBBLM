Carbon-14 are present within all live objects in small amount, and once that species pass, it starts absorbing carbon-14. These carbon-14 of that organism's dies starts to decay, and the rates at that they decays is measured to determine an age of that specimen. Record 14 bearing are some type of radiometric dated, that uses a reaction in radioactive isotopes to measure the ages for materials. radioactive dating is based from the principle where certain isotopes, the types of atoms, decay at a known length throughout time. After measuring an quantity in a particular isotope available in the samples, scientist may know how far later the materials were formed or how much its had been before this reaction occurred.
