Go are formed when water seeps into cracks in the road surface and then freezes or expands. When the ice thaws, this creates an void and hole on that road surfaces.

Carbon 14 dated, also known as radiocarbon dating, is an method of determining the age for an object that was once lived by using the amount of carbon-14, the radioactive isotope in nitrogen, which contains. Carbon-14 are present within all live objects in small amount, and once the organisms die, it starts absorbing carbon-14. These carbon-14 of that organism's dies starts to decay, and these rates at that they decays is measured to determine the age of the specimen. C 14 bearing are some type of radiometric dating, that uses a reaction in nuclear isotopes to measure the ages for materials. radioactive dating is based from the principle where certain isotopes, the types of atoms, decay at a known length throughout time. After measuring an quantity in the particular isotope visible in a specimen, scientist may know how far later the materials were formed or how much its had been before this reaction occurred. Carbon 14 dating was most often employed to identify the age for biological material, much as bone, bone, and shells. It have also used to dates archaeological or geological material, with ancient artifacts and rocks.
