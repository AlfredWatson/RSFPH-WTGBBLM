Carbon 14 date, sometimes called as radiocarbon dating, is a technique of determining the age of an object that was once living by measuring the amount of carbon-14, a radioactive isotope in that, that contains. Carbon-14 is found in all live things in small quantities, and once the organism dies, it stops absorbing carbon-14. This carbon-14 of that organism's dies seems to decay, and a rates at which they decays is used to determine the age in the sample. C 14 dating are a kind of radiometric dated, that uses a decay in nuclear isotopes to judge the ages of substances. Radiometric dated is based on the principle a particular isotopes, or types of atoms, decay to a known rates over time. After measuring the amount of any given isotope available on a specimen, we can determine how far exactly the material were formed or how longer it has been for that reaction occurred. Carbon 14 dates are most often used to measure the age of biological materials, particular as wood, bone, and shells.
