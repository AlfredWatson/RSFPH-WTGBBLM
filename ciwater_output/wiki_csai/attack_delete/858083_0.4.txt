Description (DL) is a family of formal knowledge representation languages that can be used to represent the concepts and in of. DLs are used the, persons, and relationships up a, and about properties relationships. In DL, is represented by of (called " ") have certain set properties. For, "puppy" may be represented by set all, and have such as " has four legs "and"barks". DLs additionally allow of complex concepts using logical operators, as "and", " ", and "not". instance, the "small" may be a is small less lbs. additionally the definition of. For instance, " is of " may be between "person"and"baby". This enables DLs to represent between, the fact that " " is type of " ", which is type "mammal". DLs are used applications, artificial intelligence, language processing, information. They are particularly useful for representing and reasoning complex domains many ideas, biology or the legal system.

It inexpensive,, and use, and it be easily edited by. However, it also slow and inflexible, and has replaced magnetic and disks.
Temporal (TD) learning is a type of reinforcement learning algorithm that is used to learn about the expected future of's in a Markov (). It a type of-reinforcement learning, means does require model or its order to learn. learning, estimates of state or by using error (TD error) to update value. is calculated as the between the expected reward for an action and the received. This error is then used update the function, which the agent decisions which actions in. TD can to functions both values (the expected being in state) values (the future reward a particular action). can also be learn expected rewards policies, which of that the follows different. TD learning several over reinforcement learning algorithms. is simple implement, and can learn online, it can value function as it receives new rewards transitions. It effective at delayed, which in many real-world environments.
