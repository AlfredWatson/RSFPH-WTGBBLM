Signal is the study of activities that modify or analyze. A signal is a of a physical or, as, photographs, or other, data. involves the algorithms to and in to the some manner. There various signal, digital processing (DSP), includes the computers to process signals, and signal, analog circuits devices to process signals. processing can be a broad variety applications, notably, audio processing, image video investigation, imaging, and sonar,. tasks filtering, unwanted or a signal;, signal redundant or unwanted; and, converts a from one form, sound wave signal. Signal processing can be used to quality of signal, as by removing or, to extract a, establishing shapes or features.
logic is a branch of mathematical logic that deals with statements (propositions) of being or. to "formulas" they broken components. In, logical such as "and," "or,"and"not" combine propositions into more complex. example, if " it is, " we can " " connective to form the proposition " is and grass. " Propositional useful representing and about between statements, it basis for advanced systems such logic and modal.
A decision mechanism (MDP) is a mathematical framework for modeling decision-making in situations where outcomes are random partly control a decision maker. to dynamic behavior system, in of system on taken by maker and the of. In, a maker (also as an) in a sequence of discrete steps, to another. each time step, the gets incentive present and action taken, and reward influences agent's decisions. MDPs often in artificial machine solve involving making, controlling robot which investments. are economics model and estimate. An is setting of, setting of, a transition function describes given a. goal in MDP strategy that maximizes cumulative time, given probabilities and rewards for each state. This can techniques dynamic programming or reinforcement learning.
refers to a situation in which one or more in a game or decision-process do have about options available to consequences their actions. In, the players not complete of situation decisions based or limited information. occur settings, games, economics, even. example, in game of, players cards other players and must make on they and the the other. In the market, not information the future a must investment on. In everyday, have having information the potential or the preferences other involved. information lead uncertainty-making processes can significant impacts on outcomes of and-world situations. It an in game, economics, other decision-making under uncertainty.

A model is a probabilistic model for representing the relationships between variables in a graph. variable represented a the, and the edges represent between the. graph encodes independencies the, distribution variables can be by the the that are connected by graph. Graphical models are used represent which the between the variables are uncertain or to quantify. a useful tool for modeling and data, particularly the fields machine learning, modeling, artificial intelligence. two of: models, as, undirected graphical models, Markov random. graphical, the edges in causal relationship the variables, while an, the edges represent between the variables. models a and complex, and been applied a of problems,,, processing, and others.
