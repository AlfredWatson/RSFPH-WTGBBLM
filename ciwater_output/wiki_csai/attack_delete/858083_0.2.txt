It enables one to efficiently compute the gradient of a with respect to its inputs, which is necessary in machine learning, optimization, and scientific computing. AD can be used to differentiate a function that is as a sequence elementary operations (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and functions (such as exp,, and sin). By applying the chain rule repeatedly, can compute of the function with respect to, without the need to manually derive derivative use calculus. There are two principal approaches to: mode and reverse. Forward computes the derivative of with to each input, while reverse mode the derivative of the with to all of the inputs simultaneously. Reverse mode AD is more efficient the number of inputs much larger than the number of outputs, while forward AD is more efficient number of outputs is larger than the number of. AD has many applications in machine learning, where it is used to compute gradients of loss functions with respect to the model parameters during training. It is also used in, where it can be to find the minimum or maximum a function by descent or other. computing, AD can used to sensitivity of a model or simulation its inputs, or to parameter by minimizing difference between predictions and observations.
